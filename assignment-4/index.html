    <pre>Some say the world will end in fire,
          Some say in ice.
          From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
          I hold with those who favor fire.
          But if it had to perish twice,
          I think I know enough of hate
          To say that for destruction ice
          Is also great
          And would suffice.
