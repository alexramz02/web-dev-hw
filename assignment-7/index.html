    <h1>Lyrics</h1>
    <pre>
      Gang, gang, gang
      They talkin' down on my name, don't let 'em run off with the name
      Man I just run with the gang, A$AP boys came with the flame
      Gang, gang, they talkin' down on the gang
      They wanna rep with the name, but this ain't no regular name
      Gang, gang, they tryna run with the name
      I might pull up with three K's, but I do not fuck with no Klan
      I'm done with adjustin' to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
      Gang, gang, I tell her come fuck with the gang
      I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
      It's time to fuck up the whole game!

      Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
      In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
      My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, "Cover your eyes
      'Cause smokin' with me, you go blind"
      She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
      Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
      Was born in the dark, I can't even open my blinds
      On Yams and that's word to my mom
      Margiela Mad Man with cases I'm still tryna beat
      A bunch of shit from a long time ago
      The bigger they are, the harder they fall
      Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
      When it's my time to go, adios, vamonos
      Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with platanos
      Dealing with life and its highs and lows
      I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
      I guess it's called livin', shit I suppose
      I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
      You talk about spending or buyin' clothes
      I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
      I still had the vision when I was broke, fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
      Flyin' out womens to borin' shows, I pray to God I don't overdose
      I put A$AP on my tat, I put New York on the map
      I put the gang on the flame, they gon' remember the name
      They robbin' boys for the chain, I got Goyard by the sack
      I got the boof by the pack, I fucked your boo in her back

      Gang, gang, them boys not flexing the same
      I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
      Gang, gang, I tell her come fuck with the gang
      I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
      It's time to fuck up the whole game!
      (Game, game, game, game)

      Gang, gang
      They tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name
      True to truth somehow (gang, gang)
      But never truly lied at all, then and now
      They tryna front on the gang
      Truth somehow
      Gang, A$AP boys come with the flame
      But never truly lied at all, then and now
      True to truth somehow
      But never truly lied at all, then and now

      True to truth somehow
      But never truly lied at all, then and now
      True to truth somehow
      But never truly lied at all, then and now
      True to truth somehow
      But never truly lied at all, then and now
      True to truth somehow
      But never truly lied at all, then and now
      In my dreams, I'm dying all the time
      True to truth somehow
      But never truly lied at all, then and now
      Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
      But never truly lied at all
      But never truly lied at all, then and now
      I never meant to hurt you (then and now)
      I never meant to lie
