The internet is a network made up of many networks around the world and the web is the collection of information you can access
via the internet

Every device that is connected to the internet has an Internet Protocol address. The device you are using sends packets of
information that then reach Domain Name Servers that point the packets in the right direction. They then hit another DNS and 
so on and so forth till they reach their destination. Once that server recieves your packet it sends information back.

A directory is basically a filing system, kind of like a folder, for all of the files that go into it.

Using a VCS is benificial becasue it allows someone else to work along side you while you are coding to identifty mistakes you
might have made. It also allows for you to go back and delete the issue/ fix the issue with out having to delete everything.
